     Why Us? 
    </h3>
    <p>
      People looking to buy a new home are usually more conservative in terms of their budget and market strategies. This website aims to analyse various parameters, such as the preferred area and location, the size and total square footage of the home, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms needed, and many other basic requirements, and predict the price accordingly to help a family find a new home.</p>
     <p>
     This website eliminates the need for a real estate agent to inquire about home prices and allows users to search for homes according to their budget.</p>
